**MY HABIT TRACKER IN PYTHON**

This Python habit tracker application is designed to help users create, manage, and analyze
habits on a periodic basis (daily and weekly). The application tracks user engagement with
habits and provides basic analytics, such as identifying the longest streak of a habit and
highlighting habits that receive the least attention. This application is written in Python 
code and it uses SQLite as the backend database to store and manage the data. Users can 
interact with the application via the command-line interface (CLI).
