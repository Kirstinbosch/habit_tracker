# Class is a blueprint for creating new objects
Class: Humam

# Object is an instance of a class
Objects: John, Mary, Jack

# Attributes: 
class attributes - attribute that every object shares, species = "Human"
instance attribute - unique attributes to each user (name or race)

# Methods: method of a class - operates on the class rather than any specific instance (creating factory methods),  
method of an instance - operates on an instance of the class
Instance Methods: When the method relies on the instanceâ€™s attributes or behavior (e.g., name, eye_color).
Class Methods: When the method deals with class-level data or functionality shared across all instances, or to create alternative constructors.

# Control over an attribute in a class
Use property - an object that sits in front of an attribute and allows us to set the value of an attribute
@property
